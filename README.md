# Edge-Computing-Real-time-adaptive-secheduling-disertation

Methodology Plan:


1. Set up the simulation environment: 
Begin by installing EdgeCloudSim and configuring simulation parameters,
such as the number of edge devices, cloud servers, communication models, and task characteristics.

2. Define task attributes: Clearly specify the characteristics of each task, 
including required processing capacity, data size, and any communication requirements like latency and bandwidth.

3. Develop an adaptive task-scheduling algorithm: Create a real-time adaptive task-scheduling algorithm 
that considers the current system state, including edge devices' and cloud servers' processing capabilities,
as well as communication latency. This algorithm should dynamically adjust task assignments based on changing conditions.

4. Measure service time: Within the scheduling algorithm, implement mechanisms to measure the service time for each task. 
Initiate a timer when a task is assigned to a device or server and stop it once the task completes. 
This will yield the total service time, accounting for processing and communication.

5. Store data in the edge orchestrator: As tasks finish, 
store the measured service time data in the edge orchestrator. Utilize appropriate data structures or databases for efficient management of this information.
The edge orchestrator serves as a central repository for collected service time data.

6. Analyze the results: Upon completing the simulation, analyze the stored service time data to gain insights into the system's performance.
Evaluate the adaptive task-scheduling algorithm based on factors such as response times, task completions, and resource utilization.
This analysis will reveal how well the algorithm adapts to changing conditions and its comparative performance against other scheduling approaches.

7. Refine the algorithm: Based on the analysis results, identify areas for improvement in the adaptive task-scheduling algorithm. 
Refine the algorithm iteratively and repeat the simulation to assess whether the adjustments lead to enhanced performance.

8. Compare with existing algorithms: To validate the effectiveness of the adaptive task-scheduling algorithm further, 
compare its performance with other established task-scheduling algorithms in EdgeCloudSim. 
This comparative analysis will provide a broader perspective on the algorithm's strengths and weaknesses.

9. Share findings: If the adaptive task-scheduling algorithm demonstrates promising results, consider disseminating your research findings through relevant academic journals or conferences.
